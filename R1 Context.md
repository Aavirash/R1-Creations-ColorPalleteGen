What is R1 hardware device?

Rabbit R1 is a small, standalone gadget built to let users talk to AI and have it understand and perform tasks for them. It features a colorful, card-based interface and supports touch, scroll wheel, and button controls. With the latest rabbitOS 2 update, R1 allows users to create their own tools, games, and experiences by simply conversing with the device—no coding required. The device aims to make AI-powered software creation accessible to everyone and is positioned as a playful, creative platform that grows with its users.

What is Creations?

“Creations” is introduced as a new addition to rabbitOS 2 for the R1 device. It allows any user to create their own apps, games, or experiences directly on the device simply by having a real-time conversation with the Rabbit intern agent. Users describe what they want, and the agent builds it for them on the spot—no technical background or coding skills are needed. The feature is designed to make software creation accessible to everyone and is described as the first step toward a new kind of app store, where users can also share their creations with others via QR codes. This is the first version of “Creations,” so it’s still experimental, but it aims to empower users to customize their R1 experience easily. ​
